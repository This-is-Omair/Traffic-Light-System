# Traffic-Light-System
Project Description and goals:
Todayâ€™s traffic control system can handle such a situation but not that much effectively because they are static in nature. We need a system which is dynamic in nature so that it can handle traffic smoothly and such a system called Automatic Traffic Control System. Here we are creating the same dynamic traffic control system which can control the traffic as well as avoid the congestion of roads. It will work in a way; it provides the instruction to the driver whether to drive through the intersection or yield at the intersection. In this report we proposed a method of automatic traffic light control system using 8051 microcontrollers. By this way we would overcome the method of traditional traffic system and replacing it with our methods. In our method, during a particular period the traffic lights allows the vehicles in the north and stops them in the other directions and similarly with the other vehicles in every other direction one after another in clockwise. During this process, the pedestrian lights turn green every time the traffic light stops the vehicles, this allows a safe movement for freeway people.
